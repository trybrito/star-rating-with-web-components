## About the component

<p>
  Developed based on the concepts of Shadow DOM and reusable Web Components, which are, simply put, snippets of HTML, CSS and JavaScript code completely isolated in a JavaScript class, which is instantiated, action that renders the component, when an HTML tag, whose name matches the signature made in the JavaScript customElements object's "define" method, is placed in the HTML file; the component in question consists of a fully functional star rating that is rendered from the "star-rating" tag.
